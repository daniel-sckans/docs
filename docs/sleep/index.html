            Sleep sounds noice.

            <br><br>You drift off almost immediately.  You dream of a strange, futuristic object, about the size of an index card.  It's trying to tell you something.  You lift it up and manipulate it, and after some effort manage to unlock its hidden message: it tells you that your sister needs you to look after her cat.

            <br><br>â€¦that's when you realize that you've been awake this whole time, and you've checked your phone.
